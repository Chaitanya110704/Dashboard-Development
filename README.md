Description of the Interactive Sales Dashboard (Dash App)
This Python script builds an interactive sales analytics dashboard using the Dash framework and Plotly for visualizations. It simulates a large dataset of sales transactions and presents dynamic visual insights through an intuitive web interface.

Key Features:
1.Data Simulation:
Generates 100,000 synthetic sales records with randomized customer names, products, quantities, and prices.
Calculates total price per order based on quantity and unit price.
2.Dashboard Layout:
A title header and a dropdown menu allow users to filter by customer name.
Displays three interactive visualizations:
Total Sales by Product: A bar chart showing cumulative revenue per product.
Average Order Value by Selected Customer: A bar chart highlighting how much the selected customer spends per product on average.
Product Purchase Frequency: A pie chart visualizing how often each product is purchased across all transactions.
3.Interactivity:When a user selects a different customer from the dropdown, the relevant graphs update automatically to reflect the filtered data.
4.Usage:
Ideal for demonstrating real-time updates and exploratory sales data analysis.
Suitable as a template for real-world dashboards with actual sales databases.
This script showcases the power of Dash for building modern, interactive web-based business intelligence tools using only Python.
